# Welcome to Team 'Q'rED

### Are you still in the 'Q'ueue?
We are a team of enthusiasts, geeks, thinkers and above all determined people aiming to work and try and bring about a change in the society.
This is the official website for the team QrED, where you can check out our work and our team.  

## What exactly is 'Q'rED?
QrED is a project which aims at reducing the extensive, never ending, blood boiling, CNG refilling station queues. Yeah, that was serious exaggeration. But, seriously we aim at reducing those long queues at these stations, by guiding our users to stations that are less crowded and in effect saving both money, time and resources.
